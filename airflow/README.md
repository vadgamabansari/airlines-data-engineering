## Apache Airflow DAGs

This folder contains codebase for our **Apache Airflow DAGs** (Directed Acyclic Graph) that we have created for orchestration for our project. The Apache Airflow DAGs in this project are designed to **automate** and **orchestrate** our **data pipelines** efficiently. 

These DAGs handle the **scheduling, execution, and monitoring of tasks** related to data ingestion, transformation, and processing for flight-related information. 

By leveraging Airflow, we ensure that all **workflows are executed in the correct sequence**, with clear dependencies, providing transparency and **control over the entire data processing lifecycle**.
